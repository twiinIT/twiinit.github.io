### Objectives

- Demonstrate modeling and design capabilities based on CoSApp.
- Provide a turbofan Open-Source library for training and as a base block of advanced simulations workflows.


### Current status

- A turbofan (2 shafts) architecture is covered from single physics/components to the full product, using modular intermediate assemblies.
- Multiple off-design and design strategies are available as numerical workflows.
