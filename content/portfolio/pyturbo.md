### Objectives

- Demonstrate modelling and design capabilities based on CoSApp.

- Provide a turbofan Open-Source library for training and as a base block of advanced simulations workflows.


### Outlook

- Add alternative modelings, architectures.
- Improve the learning experience with beginner to advanced tutorials.

### Current status

- A turbofan (2 shafts) architecture is covered from single physics/components to the full product, using modular intermediate assemblies.

- Multiple off-design and design strategies are available as numerical workflows.
