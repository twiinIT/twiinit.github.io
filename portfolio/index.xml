Current status A turbofan (2 shafts) architecture is covered from single physics/components to the full product, using modular intermediate assemblies. Multiple off-design and design strategies are available as numerical workflows. Turbofan engine being scaled by the user in real time.
Aircraft digital twin mounted with 2 turbofans.</description></item></channel></rss>
